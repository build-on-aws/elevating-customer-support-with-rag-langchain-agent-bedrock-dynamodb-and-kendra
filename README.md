You can check the status of your flights, as well as data related to your trip using your reservation number or passenger identification. 

And the best... ready to deploy using [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk).

## Step 1: Previous Configuration

âœ… **Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/elizabethfuentes12/aws-qa-agent-with-bedrock-kendra-and-memory.git
```

âœ… **Go to**: 

```
cd re-invent-agent
```

âœ… **Create The Virtual Environment**: by following the steps in the [README](/re-invent-agent/README.md)

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
for windows: 

```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

âœ… **Install The Requirements**:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

âœ… **Set Values**:

In [customer_support_bot_stack.py](/customer-support-bot/customer_support_bot/customer_support_bot_stack.py) edit this line with the whatsapp Facebook Developer app number: 

`
DISPLAY_PHONE_NUMBER = 'YOU-NUMBER'
`

This agent maintains the history of the conversation, which is stored in the `session_tabble` Amazon DynamoDB table, also have control session management in the `session_active_tabble` Amazon DynamoDB table, and sets the time [here](/customer-support-bot/lambdas/code/langchain_agent_text/lambda_function.py) in this line:


`
if diferencia > 300:  #session time in seg
`

> **Tip:** [Kenton Blacutt](https://github.com/KBB99), an AWS Associate Cloud App Developer, collaborated with Langchain, creating the [Amazon Dynamodb based memory class](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/1058) that allows us to store the history of a langchain agent in an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html?sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=genaiwave&sc_content=working-with-your-live-data-using-langchain&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=mult&sc_outcome=acq).


## Step 2: Deploy The App With CDK.

Follow steps [here](/customer-support-bot/README.md)

âœ… **Synthesize The Cloudformation Template With The Following Command**:

```
cdk synth
```

âœ…ðŸš€ **The Deployment**:

```
cdk deploy
```

âœ… **Review what is deployed in the stack:** 

- Go to the [AWS Cloudformation console](onsole.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the region where you deployed and click on `CustomerSupportBotStack`:

Then go to the resources tab and explore what's deployed:

![Digrama parte 1](/imagen/stack.jpg)

âœ… **Wait a few minutes:** 

This stack automatically creates an Amazon Kendra Index with the data source that contains the [Q&A database of the airline "La inventada"](/customer-support-bot/airline-qa-base), you must wait a few minutes for all the data to be synchronized.

## LetÂ´s try!

âœ… **Q&A:** 

You can start asking for customer service information as if it were an airline customer service line.

âœ… **Passenger information:** 

The CDK stack creates the dynamoDB table named `Passenger_ID` with the [sample passenger dataset](/customer-support-bot/airline-dataset) [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/airline-dataset). Select one and request information regarding it. What if I now change the language and ask the AI in Spanish?

> The multilanguage function depends on the [LLM you use](https://aws.amazon.com/es/bedrock/).


âœ… **Send it voice notes:**  

> [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/lang-id.html) is able to automatically identify the languages spoken in your media without you having to specify a language code.
